To run the code with the desired model use 

modelB = TheModelBClass(*args, **kwargs)
modelB.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH), strict=False)

Use modelB for your variable when running the CNN. 

To run the program.
1) Download the datasets (regular and bias).
2) Make sure you have all the imports installed already.
2) Update the all the paths, for example, dataset = torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder('/Users/jgold/Documents/GitHub/Artifical-Intelligence-Project/Dataset', 
                                                transform=transformation) for the dataset 
3) Run the program.

You're set!

Note : If you run into errors like BrokenPipe Err, then change the num_workers to 0 at whichever part is causing the issue!
This happens due to multithreading settings on the PC.
